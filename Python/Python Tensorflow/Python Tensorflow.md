TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library for research and production. TensorFlow offers APIs for beginners and experts to develop for desktop, mobile, web, and cloud. 

### Keras
https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras
Keras is a high-level API to build and train deep learning models. It's used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production, with three key advantages:

User friendly
Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.
Modular and composable
Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks together, with few restrictions.
Easy to extend
Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for research. Create new layers, loss functions, and develop state-of-the-art models.
