####  Styled Components

####  Create React App
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
This is the best way to get down to coding without having a ton of configuration to handle.

####  Recompose
Recompose is a React utility belt which I use mainly to write Higher-Order Components and compose behaviours into components in neat ways.

####  Mobx
Redux can sometimes be an overkill. Yet, you might still want some easy-to-use state management solution that is more featured than setState().

####  MST - Mobx state tree
With MST, you need to provide the shape (type information) of you state “tree” (i.e. the models, actions, etc.) which is automatically leveraged to generate a living tree of immutable, structurally shared snapshots of your state.
